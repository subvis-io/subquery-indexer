### Future plan

**Short-term goal**:  

1. Provide deeper insight into staking and help nominators find the ideal validators. 
    - Define several parameters to help user easily find the target validators.
        - User can filter/sort validators by different criteria e.g. most reputable, most profitable etc...
    - More visualised data
    - Include data of a validator's participation in governance

2. Widen the options of staking in the ecosystem
    - Add parachains (Moonriver, Karura) staking data into the dashboard by indexing them from Subquery

**Long-term goal:** 

1. Portfolio management
    - Enable connecting wallet to nominate or manage validators/collators.
    - Check validator/collator health with more in-depth data

2. Predict return more accurately
    - Advanced version of the calculator: user are able to calculate return based on the validator(s) they choose

3. Extend the staking data we cover
    - Include off-chain data of a validator
